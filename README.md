A small sample Counter app, which I created while doing a Live Coding Challenge, built in **React** and **TypeScript** using **React Hooks**, **CSS**, Babel, Webpack, etc. Scope of this App:
- A **Counter** component.
- Maintaining the existing count in state and **Viewing** it on the top.
- **Adding** and **Subtracting** to the current count using the steps of **1** and **5**.
- Maintaining and showing the **History** of all the actions performed upon the counter after every state update.
- Evaluating and showing the **Maximum Number** from the **History** after every state update.

Steps to run the Variable Counter App:
- Run command <code>yarn install</code> on the root directory of Variable Counter App to install the node packages.
- Run the App by running the command <code>yarn start</code> on the root directory.
- Access the app in your browser with: <code>http://localhost:3000</code>
